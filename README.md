One of my first ANSYS projects! 

This project simulates a PET Bottle Rocket showing how pressurized air and water can make the bottle soar!
The main goal was to determine the drag coefficient, meaning how much air slows down the bottle during flight. 

Had so much fun working on this problem for IPT 2025 last year!

Watch the bottle's flight in a simulation video and check the whole solution on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/records/16685530
